### Links

- Solution URL:(https://joshvilla7.github.io/Frontend-mentor-project/)



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I learned more about CSS flexbox, and continued to get more practice with it. I also learned how to add a background overlay to the image, in order to give it that purple tint. Adding the background color overlay surprisingly took me quite a while to figure out, but I was able to find the solution.

### Continued development

I want to continue to make this web card dynamic, in which it will adjust to the user's screen size. 

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me with alot of the CSS components, and how to better use flexbox.
